# AstroImageTracker
This is a non coder's attempt at filling a common need in astrophotography.
It will analyze a folder and its sub-folders, check the FITS filenames, extract the filter and exposure times and create a report:
- Total LIGHT number of subs + total time
- Same for each filter
- Same separately for Flats

  Don't expect support from me, I have no idea what I'm doing, as this was created through chatgpt.
  Feel free to use whatever part of the code you want and modify it.
Please share any improvement.
This is windows only.
Have fun.
